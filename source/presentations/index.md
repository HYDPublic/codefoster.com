In my role as a Technical Evangelist at Microsoft, I do a lot of presentations.

I always say, the only thing I like more than writing code is _talking_ about writing code.

If I&#39;m coming to present at your event, and you need an avatar and biography, you can get those here:

    > I studied Computer Engineering and Mathematics in school a long time ago, and have thoroughly enjoyed my career course ever since - primarily teaching and software development and primarily on the web stack. I gained experience in education, aerospace manufacturing, and insurance, and eventually joined Microsoft with the goal of informing and inspiring software developers. I authored my first book CSS for Windows 8 App Development, published a couple of courses on Pluralsight.com, and try to keep up with audiences via my blog codefoster.com and my Twitter feed @codefoster. When I&#39;m not working, I&#39;m working on maker projects, spending time with my wife and two sons, hiking and camping, sailing, scuba diving, or working on house projects.

Here are some of the presentation topics that I&#39;ve recently delivered and would be ready to come share with your group...

> Introduction to Azure IoT
> All Over the Open Source Web Stack
> Using JavaScript to Make Things You Can Touch
