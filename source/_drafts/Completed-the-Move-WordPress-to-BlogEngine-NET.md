I&rsquo;ve done it. I&rsquo;ve moved off of WordPress. I&rsquo;m not sure what it is I didn&rsquo;t like about WordPress, but I just didn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re too big&hellip; shoot, I work at Microsoft. It&rsquo;s not that their blogging solution doesn&rsquo;t work because it definitely does. I guess I just felt like I was in a machine. I like to feel free.

I don&rsquo;t like to feel like any second I&rsquo;m going to get hit with another $12/yr charge because I want to add such-and-such feature.

I&rsquo;m using BlogEngine.NET now and it has thrilled me so far. It plugged in easily to my own self-hosted site and seems to have the perfect set of features. Now I feel like I can customize all I want. I feel free.
