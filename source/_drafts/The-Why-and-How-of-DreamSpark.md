Microsoft enjoys giving software away to students. It's obviously in everyone's best interest. Students get cutting edge technology and Microsoft gets young and hypercreative minds helping to shape the course of innovation for years to come.

If you are a student, signing up for DreamSpark is a no brainer. I can't think of a reason not to. The [DreamSpark website](http://www.dreamspark.com) is pretty simple, but my colleage Bret Stateham created [a slide show](http://1drv.ms/1oHc5cc) to make it just that much easier, or if you'd rather watch a very extensive video demonstration of this process as well as the process of getting a Windows Store developer account, check out [Bret's YouTube video](http://aka.ms/stusuvid). And if you want to watch a [4 minute video of me actually signing up](http://1drv.ms/1lOFcEY).

Once you're in the program, download some development software, then check out [Microsoft Virtual Academy](http://mva.ms) and get started writing curly braces. Writing code is a blast and may just help supplement your income while you work on that art history degree :)
