title: Dynamic Link to Internet Calendars

I&rsquo;m really not sure how I missed this little trick all these years. Sometimes I spend significant bits of time doing something the hard way before I just take 20 minutes out of my day to ask or research the easy way.

I&rsquo;ve known about .ics internet calendards for a long time. I&rsquo;ve clicked on many. I have chosen to open them and that&rsquo;s been fine, but only today I learned that I can add a reference to an .ics file in Outlook and from that point forward have a **dynamic** link to that internet calendar instead of a one-shot static view of those events.

I used this trick to bring all of my Meetup groups into my Outlook as a calendar that I can overlay with my Exchange and Live calendars. Now I&rsquo;m sittin&rsquo; pretty.

Here are the steps...;

1.  Get the URL to your online .ics file on your clipboard
2.  In Outlook right click on Other Calendards and Add Calendar
3.  Choose From Internet...;
4.  Now just paste in your URL and the rest should be self-explanitory

Ready, go!
