I recently found a wallpaper for my desktop that reminds me that it is a fundamental human tennant to create. Creation is built into us, but it's an inherantly difficult process. Many of us in many small ways forego creation for the fear of "doing it wrong" or making something that doesn't have value. But we also realize that foregoing creation is frustrating because it's what we're meant to do.

One of my favorite things about software development is the opportunity to create things that are both expressive and functional. When you make an app, you are filling a need and at the same time you are inspiring someone. If you remember that you have the opportunity to do both of those things well (as well as the opportunity to do them poorly), you'll be on your way to an app that users fall in love with.
