I'm going to give away 25 (that means you have a high chance of winning!) coupons that will get you two exams for the price of one.

Here's what you do to qualify...

*   Follow me on Twitter (http://www.twitter.com/codefoster)
*   Retweet [this tweet](https://twitter.com/codefoster/status/390620695719583745)
*   Cross your fingers

I'll randomly draw 25 people out of everyone that qualifies and send them a code via email to redeem your prize.

The drawing will be Friday, Oct 25.
