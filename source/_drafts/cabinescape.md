# The Idea
<!-- Jeremy -->
I worked together with a few fine folks from my team on a very fun hackathon project, and I want to tell you about it.

The team was myself ([@codefoster](http://twitter.com/codefoster)), Jennifer Marsman ([@jennifermarsman](http://twitter.com/jennifermarsman)), Hao Luo ([@howlowck](http://twitter.com/howlowck)), Kwadwo Nyarko ([@kjnyarko](http://twitter.com/kjnyarko)), and Doris Chen ([@doristchen](http://twitter.com/doristchen)).

The hackathon was themed on some relatively new products - namely Cognitive Services and the Bot Framework. Additionally, some members of the team were looking for some opportunity to fine tune their Azure Functions skills, so we went looking for an idea that included them all.

I've been mulling around the idea of using some of these technologies to implement an escape room, which as you may know are very popular nowadays. If you haven't played an escape room, perhaps you want to find one nearby and give it a try. An escape room is essentially a physical room that you and a few friends enter and are tasked with exiting in a set amount of time.

Exiting, however, is a puzzle. 

Our escape room project is called Cabin Escape and the setting is an airplane cabin.

# Game Play
<!-- Jeremy -->
Players start the game standing in a dark room with a loud, annoying siren and a flashing light. The setting makes it obvious that the plane has just crash landed and the players' job is to get out.

Players look around in haste, motivated by the siren, and discover a computer terminal. The terminal has some basic information on the screen that introduces itself as CAI (pronounced like _kite_ without the _t_) - the Central Airplane Intelligence system.

A couple of queries to CAI about her capabilites reveal that the setting is in the future and that she is capable of understanding natural language. And as it turns out, the first task of silencing the alarm is simply a matter of asking CAI to silence the alarm.

What the players don't know is that the ultimate goal is to discover that the door will not open until the passenger manifest is "validated," and CAI will not validate the manifest until all passengers are in their assigned seats. The only problem is that passengers don't know what their assigned seats are.

The task then becomes a matter of finding all of the hidden boarding passes that associate passengers with their seats. Once the last boarding pass is located and the last passenger takes his seat, cameras installed in the seat backs finish reporting to the system that the passenger manifest is validated and the exit door opens.

# Cloud Intelligence and Storage
<!-- Kwadwo -->
We use Azure Functions to update and retrieve the state of the game. Our Azure Functions are stateless, 
however we keep the state of every game stored in DocumentDB. In our design, every Cabin Escape
room has its own document in the state collection. For the purpose of this project, we have
one escape room that has id 'officialGameState'. 

We started by creating a 'GameState' DocumentDB database, and then creating a 'state' 
collection. This is pretty straight forward to do in the Azure portal. Keep in mind you'll need a
DocumentDB account created before you create the database and collection. 

After setting up the database, we wrote our Azure Functions. We have five functions used to update the 
game state, communicate with the interactive console (Central Airplane Intelligence - Cai for short), and
control the various systems in the plane.Azure Functions can be triggered in various ways, ranging from timed
triggers to blob triggers. Our trigger based functions were either HTTP or timer based. Along with triggers,
Azure Function can accept various inputs and outputs configured as bindings. Below are the functions in our 
cabinescape function application.

    - GamePulse: 
        * Retrieves the state of the plane alarm, exit door, smoke, overhead bins and sends commands to a raspberry piece
        * Triggerd by a timer
        * Inputs from DocumentDB
    - Environment:
        * Updates the state of oxygen and pressure
        * Triggered by a timer
        * Inputs from DocumentDB
        * Outputs to DocumentDB
    - SeatPlayer:
        * Checks to see if every player is in their seat
        * Triggerd by HTTP request
        * Inputs from DocumentDB
        * Outputs to DocumentDB and HTTP response
    - StartGame: 
        * Initializes the state of a new game
        * Triggered by HTTP request
        * Outputs to DocumentDB and HTTP response
    - State:
        * Update the state of the game
        * Triggered by HTTP request
        * Inputs from DocumentDB
        * Ouputs to DocumentDB

A limitation we encountered with timer based triggers is the inability to turn them on or off at will. 
Our timer based functions are on by default, and are triggerd based on an interval (defined with a cron expression).
In reality, game is not being played 24/7. Ideally, we want the timer based functions triggered on when the game starts,
and continue on an time interval until the game end condition is met.
