I'm a member of a lot of meetups, but one of the coolest is [SnoCo Makers](https://www.meetup.com/SnoCo-Makers/).

The SnoCo Makers Meetup group corresponds to the SnoCo Makerspace ([snocomakers.org](http://snocomakers.org/)) in Everett, WA - a cool city a bit north of Seattle with [the west coasts largest marina](http://www.nwboatinfo.com/Everett-Marina.html)! I guess that random fact gives away that I'm a boat guy.

I'm thrilled to be able to say that these days there's nothing novel about finding a good makerspace near you, but one thing makes SnoCo Makerspace stand out - it's non-profit!

I noticed the other day that the group was hosting a beginners class on welding and I've been wanting to get into welding for the longest time, so I signed up.

It was an excellent experience. I spent about 4 hours in a metal shop and got to play with 5 different machines including...

- a basic oxy acetylene cutting torch
- a plasma cutter
- a stick welder
- a wirefeed with flux core
- a wirefeed with dual shielding

The entire experience was a cursory overview of the various entry points into welding. Like the software development, welding is a broad field and comes with a lot of techniques, machinery, and intimidating terms. In my opinion, it's one of those skills that's better to learn in person than with books or websites. 

First, let me talk about the tools I used for _cutting_ metal as opposed to fusing it together. They are the oxy-acetylene cutting torch and the plasma cutter.

## The Torch
The torch is a classic. I have vivid memories of the sites and smells of cutting torches in my dad and grandpa's shops.

The classic cutting torch mixes oxygen and acetylene to create a flame that's hot enough to cut through metal.

There's a bit of know-how in hooking up the gases, finding the right pressures, and knowing which one to crank up first. And someone has to show you how to read the flame and dial up or down the oxygen or the acetylene. Once you've got it, though, cutting is mostly intuitive.

And it definitely feels good to cut metal with fire. I think that's innate in every man.

## The Plasma Cutter
The plasma cutter just has a cool name. When someone hands you something called a _plasma cutter_, you know you're fixin' to do something awesome.

In my (admittedly very basic) understanding, a plasma cutter uses an electric arc to liquify the metal immediately under the tip and then a very fine stream of compressed air blasts the molten material away.

The finished cut of a plasma cutter is much cleaner than that of a cutting torch. It think this is because the molten material is blasted away with that fine stream of air instead of trying to flow out of the way as with the cutting torch. 

Notice in the following sign how smooth the cuts are despite my jagged line.

I'm reminded of that famous saying... "to be handy a person just needs WD-40 and duct tape - WD-40 to make things go and duct tape to make them stop."

Likewise, the former two machines - the torch and the plasma cutter - make things come apart, whereas the next three hold them together. Let's talk about the stick welder and then two different configurations of a wire feed welder.

## The Stick welder
The stick welder is another classic and rather simple contraption.

A stick welder allows you to fix one piece of metal to another by adding material at the seam. It's essentially an electric generator that creates a high voltage between two leads. You attach a lead (the negative lead) to metal part 1 (or to a metal table that's _touching_ metal part 1) and the other (the positive) to a _stick_ - that is, a welding rod.

>The welding rod is the _consumable_ in this equation. The metal core of the rod is what gets liquified and ends up holding your pieces of metal together.

When you tap the rod to the seam between metal part 1 and metal part 2, an arc forms that liquifies the welding rod.

I was a bit concerned with safety, but those in the know assured me that it's no simple matter to get yourself a shock from a stick welder, yet despite my familiarity with at least basic electric principles, I can't say I understand why not. 

I personally had a hard time preventing the rod from sticking to the piece when first struck, but I was told it was because of less than ideal contacts between the leads and the metal parts. I'm assuming just the right setup would make this a pretty basic activity.

## The Wirefeed with Flux Core
The wirefeed machines really turn the dial up on technology, and it sounds like they turn the dial up on cost too. It seems worth it though when things are going as planned.

A wire feed machine is working on the same basic principle as the stick welder - a consumable metal that is liquified using an electric arc. The wire feed machines, however, take a spool of wire and constantly drive it through the hose and welding tip. This means you don't buy welding rods and switch one out when you get to the end of it.

I didn't mention it before, but a welding rod has an outer coating that is a flux. The flux forms a shield around the molten metal as it forms a bead on your seam and does a number of good things for you: it makes the metal stronger by creating an alloy effect, it causes the molten metal to flow and bead more predictably, and it forms a protective layer that keeps air (oxygen and nitrogen and other contaminates) away.

In a wirefeed machine, that function is served by putting a core of flux in the middle of the wire so that as the wire is consumed, your welding tip always has some consumable metal and some flux.

## The Wirefeed with Dual-Shielding
Wirefeed machines may or may not use gas too. If you're _not_ using gas, then you're just counting on the flux core to protect your weld. If you _are_ using gas, however, the gas (either CO2 or argon) is blown out the tip _around_ the wire essentially blowing away all the bad stuff and replacing it with an inert (doesn't bother the weld) gas.

When gas and flux core are used, it's called _dual-shielding_, because your weld is being "shielded" from the elements by both methods.

I didn't spend enough time welding with both methods to remember how they compared, but from the mouth of experts the dual-shielded weld is a lot easier to make smooth and consistent. It is better for welding indoors, though, since a breeze can displace the gas coming out of the tip and destroy the shielding effect.

## The Damage
Four days after welding I developed a sore finger. I suspected metal slivers and a glance through my son's digital microscope confirmed that suspicion. 
I was wearing approved welding gloves throughout the entire process, but it sounds like these things are pretty tough to avoid.

I hit record on the microscope, so in case this is a bit fascinating to you like it was to me, here you can see my wife using tweezers to remove a strand embedded in my nail and then the tip of a needle removing the piece that was really causing the pain from my nail bed.

## The Conclusion
Well, that's it. Again, this was an excellent and inspiring activity for me, and I've looked all over my yard looking for enough projects to justify an entry-level welder of my own. A severe lack of time will probably keep me from moving on that decision though.

Finally, I think I was clear that I'm a total baby in this field, so if you're reading this with some welding experience, by all means, please drop a comment below and correct or augment to your heart's content.
