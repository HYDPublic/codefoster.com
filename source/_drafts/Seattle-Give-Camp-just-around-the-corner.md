In less than two months, a number of charities will gather in the Commons on the Microsoft campus with a lot of project requirements to share. Those projects will be matched up with developers from the area that are willing to give a weekend to help out a good cause. Many hours will be spent furiously designing and coding away, and at the end of the weekend the fruits will be shared.

I haven&rsquo;t been to a Give Camp before, but I&rsquo;ve heard that it&rsquo;s pretty remarkable what can get accomplished in a weekend and how helpful it is to the charities. Many of these groups are on very tight budgets and don&rsquo;t normally have IT help or don&rsquo;t have nearly enough.

If you&rsquo;re going to be around the weekend of October 19-21, I encourage you to go to [http://seattlegivecamp.org](http://seattlegivecamp.org) and sign up as a volunteer designer or developer. Even if you don&rsquo;t have technical skills, you can volunteer to cover other needs. You can put your skills to a really good use and probably end up having a good time to boot.

I hope I&rsquo;ll see you there.
