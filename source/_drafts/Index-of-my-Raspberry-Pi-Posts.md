I&#39;ve been doing a lot of hacking on the Raspberry Pi, and I&#39;ve written a few articles on the topic. I&#39;ve assembled all of my posts here for easy access.

*   [_Accidental Old Version of Node on the Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-oldnode/) -&nbsp;I beat my head against a wall for a long time wondering why I wasn&#39;t able to do basic GPIO on a Raspberry Pi using Node. Even after a fresh image and install, I was getting cryptic node error messages when I ran my basic blinky app.Lucky for me (and perhaps you) I got to the bottom of it and am going to document it here for posterity.
*   [_The Most Basic Way to Access GPIO on a Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-basicgpio) -&nbsp;I&#39;m always looking for the lowest level understanding, because I hate not knowing how things work. On a Raspberry Pi, I&#39;m able to write a Node app that changes GPIO, but how does that work? Turns out it&#39;s pretty interesting. I&#39;ll show you.
*   [_Easy and Offline Connection to your Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-easyoffline) -&nbsp;Getting a Raspberry Pi online is really easy if you have an HDMI monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but what about if you want to get connected to your Pi while you&#39;re, say, flying on a plane?
*   [_Wifi on the Command Line on a Raspberry Pi_](http://codefoster.com/pi-wifi/) -&nbsp;How to configure wireless connections on your Raspberry Pi from the command line.
