It has never been a good idea to jump right into development without putting time into the design of your project. It&rsquo;s tempting to attribute your progress to the time when you&rsquo;re actually typing the code into the computer, but application design like never before is more than fluff. It scopes and directs your efforts and saves you from real hours spent on divergent, throw-away work.

This is still true in Windows 8 development, but a lot of work has already been done to support application developers in creating Metro style applications. There&rsquo;s a lot of design philosophy in the platform. The effort of which is to create an application ecosystem that has some consistency and thus some predictability and thus user joy.

Here&rsquo;s a video I recorded that will walk you through the design philosophy &ndash; the 8 traits of Metro style design. Enjoy. Happy designing.
