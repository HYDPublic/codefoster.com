To everyone who joined [@mjconnection](http://www.twitter.com/twitter) and I ([@codefoster](http://www.twitter.com/codefoster)) at the Windows 8 App Accelerator the last 3 days, thanks for bringing all the energy, questions, and app ideas! I know I had a great time.

I promised everyone that I would provide a list of resources that we brought up in class. If you think of any more that I missed, feel free to leave it in a comment and I'll merge it into this list.

Keep me posted on the progress of your apps!

## Metro Tile Sources

[The Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com) - this is a great collection of icons that represent things... you know... nouns

[Icon Finder](http://www.iconfinder.com) - find icons on the web and get either the PNG or the ICO file

[Icons8.com](http://www.icons8.com) - a cache of free glyphs that work well with Windows 8 Metro style tiles and art

[The XAML Project](http://www.thexamlproject.com) - more

[SyncFusion Metro Studio](http://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio) - more

[http://raphaeljs.com/icons/](http://raphaeljs.com/icons/) - more

## Visual Studio Add-Ins

[Debugger Canvas](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/hh227299) - use this to visualize your code and your call stack while you're debugging. It even supports visualization of multi-threaded stacks and recursive functions.

[Bug Aid](http://www.bugaidsoftware.com) - some more great help visualizing C# entities while you're debugging

[ReSharper 7 EAP](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+7+EAP) - perhaps the biggest source of developer joy you can ask for

## Art Tools

[Inkscape.com](http://www.inkscape.com) - this is an awesome vector based graphics tool. If you're still using a bitmap based image editing tool for generating app art, you should stop in your tracks and learn to use vector.

[Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com) - a color palette picker.

[ColourLovers.com](http://www.ColourLovers.com) - again

[colorschemedesigner.com](http://colorschemedesigner.com) - again

None of these support Windows 8 yet of course, but they were mentioned in class so I thought I should include them...
