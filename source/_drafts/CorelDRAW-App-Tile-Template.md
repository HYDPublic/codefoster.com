In case you haven't heard, Microsoft has an incentive [link removed] going on right now where any app you create, you can get $100 for. That's not bad considering how easy it is to make an app. Well, not all apps are easy. Some apps take quite a substantial bit of time, but if you're just trying to get a good app into the Windows Store quickly (like say for $100!) there are some tricks you should know. There's a template at [w8templates.codeplex.com](http://w8templates.codeplex.com), for instance, that you can customize with a few search terms and RSS feeds and in a matter of minutes, you've got a data and media rich app all about the topic of your choice.

I just made an app using this template. It's called The Sailing App. One of the tasks you'll have to complete if you go down this road is to create your own graphics for the app tiles, splash screen, etc. Well, I don't know about you, but I'm a big fan of CorelDRAW, so I made a template and I'm posting it here for you. By the way, if you'd like your very own free copy of CorelDRAW X6 Essentials, just join a ZERO260 event [link removed]. We're giving them away.

Here's that template. Have fun!
