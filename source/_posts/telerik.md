If you haven&#39;t seen Telerik&#39;s Windows 8 controls, you should check it out. Just go to telerik.com and install the trial and then open the demo app (there&#39;s one for HTML/JS and one for XAML/C#) in Visual Studio and launch it.

Their presentation is awesome and the controls themselves are way cool. They&#39;re simple and clean and have just the right amount of animation &ndash; enough to make them look alive but not so much they look brassy.
