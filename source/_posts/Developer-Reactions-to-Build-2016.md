Microsoft takes opportunity every year at [//build](http://build.microsoft.com) - its annual conference for developers - to make as many shock and awe announcements as it can, and this year in 2016, there was plenty of shock and plenty of awe.

Maybe you&#39;ve watched all the keynotes already. Maybe you&#39;ve even watched all of the sessions already. We&#39;re going to assume, however, that even if you have seen or otherwise caught wind of the announcements that you would like to get an answer to the question &quot;What does that mean for me?&quot;

In this post, I&#39;m going to invite a number of colleagues - all Microsoft Technical Evangelists - to share in detail via blog posts and videos about their favorite announcements, and what they mean for you - the developer.

This is an active blog post that will be updated as new content lands, so check back often.

We&#39;ll start with a [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com) introduction to a few of the team. In this video&nbsp;you&#39;ll meet...
