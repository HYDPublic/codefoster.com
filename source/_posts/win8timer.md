Ready for the shortest blog post in history?

Looking for a time in Windows 8? Look no further. Just drop this code into the App constructor on the App.xaml.cs page...

``` js
    var d = new DispatcherTimer();
    d.Start();
    d.Tick += (sender, o) => { Debug.WriteLine("tick"); };
```

Now go take a look at Visual Studio's Output pane and watch it tick.
