I just opened up guest commenting on codefoster.com.

I'm generally in favor of _identity_ on the web and generally not a huge fan of _anonymity_. Pretty much every anonymous forum I've been to online is littered with the darkest parts of mankind. It's a sad state really.

So consider this an experiment to see if anonymity will encourage good community on codefoster.com and if manual comment moderation is feasible and sustainable.

We'll see. Please comment :)
