I just opened up guest commenting on codefoster.com.

I&#39;m generally in favor of _identity_ on the web and generally not a huge fan of _anonymity_. Pretty much every anonymous forum I&#39;ve been to online is littered with the darkest parts of mankind. It&#39;s a sad state really.

So consider this an experiment to see if anonymity will encourage good community on codefoster.com and if manual comment moderation is feasible and sustainable.

We&#39;ll see. Please comment :)
