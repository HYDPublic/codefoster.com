I've done it. I've moved off of WordPress. I'm not sure what it is I didn't like about WordPress, but I just didn't. It's not that they're too big... shoot, I work at Microsoft. It's not that their blogging solution doesn't work because it definitely does. I guess I just felt like I was in a machine. I like to feel free.

I don't like to feel like any second I'm going to get hit with another $12/yr charge because I want to add such-and-such feature.

I'm using BlogEngine.NET now and it has thrilled me so far. It plugged in easily to my own self-hosted site and seems to have the perfect set of features. Now I feel like I can customize all I want. I feel free.
