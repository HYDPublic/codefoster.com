One of my university professors once said that "Software is the most complex creation of man."

I think I'm drawn to software development and to technology in general precisely _because_ it's complex. It's a field I know I'll never reach the extents of. It will never run up against boundaries with how creative I can be with technology, and I'll never run out of new concepts to learn.

So that's what I love to do - to be involved with learning and teaching technology. That's why I usually say opportunities to present online learning courses.

In April 2017, presented a course on Microsoft Virtual Academy called _Introduction to Azure IoT_. I'll provide a direct link to the content here as soon as it's available.

The course served to introduce curious viewers to IoT in general as well as to the broad offerings of Azure in the area of IoT, and it also served to introduce viewers to the more in-depth course on the same subject available on the [edX](http://edx.org) platform. I'll provide a link to that content too when it's launched.

For now, I'll make the full slide deck available and give you a bit of an idea of what the content covered.

You can download [this PowerPoint deck](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvStLR7eqJbDxbU8p3yuNOjRpThE0g) to get a deeper sense of what was covered as well as to get a reference to the various external links that I used.

Here are the topics...

Hope this helps you ramp up on IoT!
