I&#39;m going to keep much of my latest project under wraps for now, but I need your help designing one piece of it.

I&#39;m looking to create a device that is small and light and will dispense one piece of candy at a time programmatically.

Here are the requirements...

1.  Light - no more than 1oz
2.  One at a time - it needs to dispense a piece of candy one at a time. If I have to constrain it to hold only round candy of a set size, then so be it, but ideally it would hold candy of varying size and shape. Ideally it will hold Runts bananas.
3.  It has to operate on a 3.7V power supply
4.  It has to be an electro-mechanical assembly that I can control with an IoT device (an easy req to fulfill I think)
5.  It should hold some reasonable number of candy pieces - say at least 10.

So far I&#39;ve thought of the following...

*   An Archimedes screw that "pumps" candy up from the bottom of a hopper (like [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Archimedes-screw_one-screw-threads_with-ball_3D-view_animated_small.gif))
*   A wheel that sits horizontal and on each incremental rotation lets one candy piece at a time fall into a hole in the top and lets another fall out a hole at the bottom
*   A screw that sits on a horizontal axis that is loaded with candy pieces (one per screw rotation... not in a hopper) and pushes one piece out at a time when rotated 360 degrees. A bit like snack vending machines.

If you can come up with any other brilliant ideas, I&#39;d be glad to hear them.

Thanks in advance.
