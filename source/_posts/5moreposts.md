Blogging is a chore. _Writing_ in general is a chore. It&#39;s not easy to formulate thoughts and put them into words. I have a ton of respect for prolific authors that generate volumes in their lifetime, because that&#39;s a phenominal feat.

I just looked at my blog statistics and I&#39;m woefully low for the year. I have only blogged 14 times in 2016 so far. That&#39;s barely over once per month, whereas I should be creating a post at _least_ every week. I started off in 2012 with 87+ posts, and have tapered down to last year (2015) at only 19. I&#39;m ashamed.

My desire is to write though. I write for you, my reader, but I certainly write for me too. It&#39;s a great discipline and as any technical blog author knows, the main reason we post is to remind our future selves how to do something we at one point knew. Tell me you haven&#39;t searched online for a technical answer only to find your own post from 2 years ago!

So here&#39;s the deal. It&#39;s currently December 8. There are about 23 days left in the year. My goal is to post at least 5 more times. Wait, this posts counts, so 4 more times. Hoorah! That&#39;s completely doable and will mean that I have not digressed from 2015.

Furthermore, it&#39;s my commitment to increase 2017 significantly. I won&#39;t put any official commitments on a number out there, but there&#39;s not reason I can&#39;t maintain a weekly cadence and produce &gt;52 posts for 2017.

Here we go!
