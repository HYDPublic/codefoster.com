I&#39;m currently studying for Microsoft exam [70-532](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-532.aspx) - Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions. I do enjoy studying for exams. It&#39;s hard, but it&#39;s an excellent forcing function. I learn bits and pieces here and there now and then about this and that, but when I have an exam schedule for a set date, I _have to study!_ And not only do I put in more hours, but I follow a more systematic approach. In this article, I&#39;m going to share my approach and give you my study guide for exam 70-532 in case you too are studying and this method works for you.

Here&#39;s my strategy...

1.  **Visit the official exam page**

	For 70-532, the page is at [https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-532.aspx](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-532.aspx)
2.  **Click _show all_ under the Skills Measured section and copy the whole thing**
3.  **Paste it into a OneNote notebook**
4.  **Format it by breaking all of the skill points out onto separate lines and adding checkboxes**
5.  **Study each point and check it off when I feel like I understand**

Here&#39;s what it ends up looking like when I&#39;m done...

So I start by asking myself if I know what a _deployment slot _is. I don&#39;t. I Bing it and find something like this [Staged Deployment on Microsoft Azure Websites article](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-staged-publishing/) that does an excellent job of defining the term and goes on to discuss the next point _roll back deployments_ as well. So I read up, try it myself, grok the concept, then check the boxes. Simple as that. Notice I said that my study process is simple. The concept aren&#39;t always, but then that&#39;s one of the reasons I like software... it&#39;s complicated!

So attached you&#39;ll find a OneNote notebook that&#39;s yours to keep. Just open it up, start studying, and start checking. And give me a shout [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/codefoster) when you pass the exam! Best of luck!
