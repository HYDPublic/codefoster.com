If you're looking for training material for Windows 8, you'll find quite a lot online. It can be overwhelming finding stuff online though. I consider it part of my job to help you locate things, so here's a tip. Just do a search in the Windows 8 Dev Center ([http://dev.windows.com](http://dev.windows.com)) for the word 'quickstart'; and you'll find a lot of walk-through articles that are really helpful in figuring out how things work. Here's a link to that search directly: [http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US/windows/apps?query=quickstart&amp;Refinement=180](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US/windows/apps?query=quickstart&amp;Refinement=180)
