I host a page at [/media](/media) that is a resource of stock assets - images, illustrations, video, fonts, etc.

I originally made this resource for myself because I was always forgetting what my favorite stock asset sites were. Over the years, though I've gotten a lot of traffic on this page proving that I'm not the only developer that dabbles in graphics and isn't foolish enough to try to create everything from scratch. I don't have the time, talent, or inspiration to consider that.

On that page, I ask readers to recommend more resources and recently somebody did.

The folks at Canva.com let me know about their free online color tool - [canva.com/colors](http://canva.com/colors), and I was so impressed that I decided to blog about it as well.

When I start a new website, create a new brand, or even start putting together a photo album for my family, I want to pick a color pallet that has some chance of looking good. In the past, I've used sites like Adobe Color CC (formerly Kuler), but I've always found them to be overkill. Canva Colors instantly struct me as a simple and clean alternative. I was also impressed right off the bat at their inclusion of some design learning. That's just what most of us developers need - to get a bit more design savvy.

I moved on from their /colors tool to check out the rest of their site and as a web developer, I'm impressed. For example, just take a look at their [About](https://about.canva.com/our-story/) page. That's snazzy.

By the way, Canva asked me if I'd like to include a link to their tool on my [/media](http://codefoster.com/media) page, but they didn't ask me or pay me to blather on about how cool their stuff is. I'm just impressed.

So head over to canva.com and check it out for yourself.
