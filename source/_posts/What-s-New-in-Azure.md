Sometimes it&#39;s the most obvious things that are the easiest for me to miss. I can see being in a usability study with the folks that designed the [new Azure portal ](http://portal.azure.com/)and giving feedback like, &quot;you know, this is great and all, but it would be really nice to get some visibility into what sort of functionality is getting added to this portal as it&#39;s added&quot;. I can see the designers ripping off their white lab coats in frustration, with clenched teeth and fists, muttering &quot;it&#39;s right... there... and it&#39;s huge!&quot;

Click on that, and you&#39;re going to get a blog essentially that enumerates all of the additions to this new version of the Azure portal as they happen. It&#39;s good visibility into this ever changing portal.

For instance,recently - on May 13 - we got the ability to [create connectors in the logic apps designer](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/create-connectors-in-logic-apps-designer/). That&#39;s helpful. Thanks, Azure team.
