My CSS for Windows 8 App Development book is done... finished... finite! You can get an ebook or an old fashioned paper style book by visiting [aka.ms/cssbook](http://aka.ms/cssbook). I hope the book adds something to your CSS skills. The source code for the listings in the book is available at [cssbookcode.codeplex.com](http://cssbookcode.codeplex.com). Enjoy!
