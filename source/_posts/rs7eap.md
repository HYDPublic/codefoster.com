I opted out of the ReSharper 7 EAP beta for a little while just because it was throwing a lot of exceptions and I had to get some code written, but now I&#39;m back and it appears they&#39;ve made a lot of improvements to it. I am noticing a lot more support in JavaScript code in Windows 8 development, so that&#39;s awesome.
<!-- xmore -->

Also, they made it work with VS 2005, 2008, and 2010\. Although, if you&#39;re still using VS2005, can I please ask you why? :)

Go [here](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/ReSharper/ReSharper+7+EAP) and  download the latest build now and try it out. ReSharper makes you more productive.
