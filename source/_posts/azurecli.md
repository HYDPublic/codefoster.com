At the time of this writing, there are two Azure portals you can use.

To get to the main, full-featured, current Azure portal, you browse to [manage.windowsazure.com](http://manage.windowsazure.com) in any modern browser, and it looks like this...

The new portal is already available for you to play with and get familiar with, and it&#39;s a good thing too since it takes quite a bit of getting used to. Once you grok it, though, I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll like it better. You get to the new portal by browsing to [portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com). Here&#39;s what it looks like...

Both of these are works of modern, web art and very functional in my opinion. I love the current portal, and now that I&#39;m accustomed to it, I love the new portal as well.

But I would like to get to the place where I have little to no need for the portals. I would like to instead to be utterly dependent on the command line.

I started some time back on the PowerShell command interface for Azure and it&#39;s very well made. I had a hard time getting to it though. I suppose it was the long commands - the PowerShell syntax. Although it&#39;s quite descriptive and offers good tab completion and documentation, I still found it a chore and kept at my work in the portal.

I had a glance some time ago at the node tooling for Azure as well, but didn&#39;t really give it a fair shake. Now I&#39;m shaking it like crazy and really excited. Check out some of these things you can do...

## Check out which Ubuntu images I can use for creating a VM...

The following will generate a list of Azure VM images and allows me to pipe to a regular expression to pull out just the stable (LTS) Ubuntu images of a certain version (14.04.1). It&#39;s also possible to add a `--json `property to the request and get this data back in JSON format.

```
azure vm image list | grep 'Ubuntu.*14_04_1.*LTS'
```

## Create an Ubuntu Linux VM from one of those images...

Once I&#39;ve chosen the image I want to start with, I simple call the following to create a new VM in the West US region. I add the `-e` parameter to add ssh capability so I can ssh into the machine when it&#39;s finished.

```
azure vm create -l 'West US' VM_NAME b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu_DAILY_BUILD-trusty-14_04_1-LTS-amd64-server-20141110-en-us-30GB codefoster -e
```

Now let&#39;s fetch a list of my VM&#39;s and see the new mynewubuntumachine in there...

By the way, if you&#39;re like me and like staying in the command line interface, try installing [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/). It runs great in PowerShell and allows me immediately after creating this VM to ssh into it like so...

I&#39;d rather that machine not start charging me for compute, so let&#39;s shut it down and make it free (except for a little bit of storage... pennies)...

That&#39;s better.

What else can we do with the azure-cli? Oh, man. Glad you asked. Let&#39;s create a quick Azure Mobile Service, add a table, and then use some PowerShell candy to start writing and reading records.

## Creating a Mobile Service...

First, we create the service like the following where gg4p4pzmfi is simply the name of my particular SQL Server. I already have it, so I may as well use that instead of creating a new one. My service is actually going to be called &quot;cfms&quot;.

```
azure mobile create --sqlServer gg4p4pzmfi cfms
```

![](/files/azurecli_08.png)

Then we create a table. Let&#39;s just punt and call it _widgets_. In order to show interactions with the table via simple HTTP commands, I&#39;m going to open up the insert and read permissions so I don&#39;t have to create authentication headers in my HTTP calls...

```
azure mobile table create cfms widgets -p read=public,insert=public
```

![](/files/azurecli_09.png)

And there we have a service with a table ready for us. Now, in case you&#39;ve never noticed, PowerShell natively allows us to use `curl `to do web requests, but curl is not really installed. Instead it&#39;s a simple alias to the Invoke-WebRequest method in PowerShell. I chose to write the following functions into my PowerShell profile so it&#39;s always available to me...

```
Function get ($uri)
{
  (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri).Content;
}

Function post ($uri, $body)
{
  (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Body $body -Method Post -ContentType "application/json").Content;
}
```

So now we can write a record into our new widgets table like so...

```
post [http://cfms.azure-mobile.net/tables/widgets](http://cfms.azure-mobile.net/tables/widgets) '{"name":"widget 1"}';
```

Do notice that the response we got back from this post included the actual inserted object complete with the GUID that Azure Mobile Services tacked on to it. In case you&#39;re not already familiar with Mobile Services, you should also take note that we didn&#39;t schematize this table when we created it. Instead, we simply created an object with a _name_ property and let Mobile Services handle that for us.

Now, a get from the same table should show us our _widget 1_ record, and in fact it does...

I love how simple and elegant a solution this is.

There&#39;s obviously a whole lot more we can do with azure-cli that I won&#39;t take the time to detail. But there&#39;s one more thing you should see - the inline help. For any command, simply tack on -h and you will get good information about the various possible parameters you can use. It&#39;s contextual too. If you type `azure -h`, you&#39;ll see all of the high level options for the azure-cli tool, whereas if you type `azure vm -h`, you&#39;ll see specific commands for working with VM&#39;s.

The azure -h is great for giving you an overview of what the tool will do.

I hope you have as much fun with this as I have already.
