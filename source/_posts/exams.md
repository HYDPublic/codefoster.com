It&#39;s was a big day in Building 33 as 100 or so people gathered to write Windows 8 apps, compete for prizes, and hopefully learn a little something along the way. One of the things attendees learned was that Microsoft Learning (MSL) is really rockin&#39; the Microsoft certifications lately. Paul Lee joined us at the hackathon to talk about the state of Microsoft certifications. They have tracks that based on software solutions and the technologies a developer would use to create them.

The one I&#39;m excited about is the _MCSD: Windows Store Apps - HTML5_. Which you can earn if you take the [70-480](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-480), [70-481](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-481), and [70-482](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-482) exams. And actually, the first of those exams is free (for now) if you go to [http://www.register.prometric.com](http://www.register.prometric.com) to schedule your exam and use HTMLJMP as your promo code. If you want help studying for 70-480 and 70-481, you can take a look at the JumpStart videos that [Michael Palermo](http://www.palermo4.com) and I recorded at [http://aka.ms/jump480](http://aka.ms/jump480) and [http://aka.ms/jump481](http://aka.ms/jump481).

Attached are the slides that Paul presented.
