I'm starting a new venture and I'm announcing it now.
<!-- more -->

It's been on my mind for some time and I'm finally going to make it happen.

It's called CodeChat and it's a casual, weekly conversation about code and the myriad of periphery topics that may be of interest to developers. Chats will be targeted at 30 minutes, but who knows. They may be 15 minutes or 40.

The first episode will air on July 7, 2014 and new episodes will be released every Monday morning until the demise of the universe.

CodeChat will be broadcast via Channel 9 which will allow me to distribute it in various formats simultaneously. I, for one, listen to a lot of podcasts and never want to be limited to audio or video. If I'm driving or jogging, the video is pointless, but when I'm just sitting around it's great to have a video feed for a more immersive experience.

I hope you'll get some value out of the discussions I have with Microsoft employees, community developers, and whoever else I decide to bring on the show.
