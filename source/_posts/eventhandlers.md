One of the nicest things about JavaScript is the way it considers function. Instead of being wholly owned subsidiaries of classes, functions are as portable as any other object, and their arguments are dynamic too. This makes for some elegant event handling.

In this screencast, I&#39;ll attempt to give you a taste of how to wire up events in a Windows 8 app using JavaScript. It&#39;s a pretty basic scope and I don&#39;t enumerate the many events available on the many WinJS controls. I also don&#39;t cover the event model around gestures or manipulations, but I hope to share more about those exciting areas later.
