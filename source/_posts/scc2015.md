Here it comes again. Seattle Code Camp happens every year and it's one of those events where you don't even think about whether or not to attend - you just attend. This year it's **September 12, 2015** at **Seattle University in the Capitol Hill area**.

As always, it's free. As always, there's food. And as always, it's a big collection of coders of every skill level presenting on subjects that inspire them and hopefully inspire you too.

Several tracks give you a wide choice of information to glean, and a couple of gatherings of the entire crowd give you a chance to rub shoulders with your peers.

If my sessions are accepted, I'll be presenting on some IoT topics. That's what really drives my boat these days. As of this writing, the speaker registration is still open. You don't have to be a wizard to present. Beginners are just as welcome as experts. So work up some courage, dust off your public speaking book from college, and sign up.

I'm looking forward to it. See you there.
