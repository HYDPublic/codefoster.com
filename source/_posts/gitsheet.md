I spend a lot of time using Git these days. It&#39;s one of those technologies you love and hate. I guess I use it because it feels just scrappy and simple and elegant enough to be the right tool for the job in most cases.


I&#39;ve heard it said and completely agree that Git would be the ideal _offline_ source control solution if you didn&#39;t have to search _online_ for the syntax.

Well, maybe this will help. GitHub was at OSCON and they were handing out these handy little cheat sheets. I&#39;m going to decorate my workstation wall with this. Perhaps you&#39;ll save it somewhere close or print and pin it yourself and get some use out of it. Hope so. Cheers.
