Here it comes again. Seattle Code Camp happens every year and it&#39;s one of those events where you don&#39;t even think about whether or not to attend - you just attend. This year it&#39;s **September 12, 2015** at **Seattle University in the Capitol Hill area**.

As always, it&#39;s free. As always, there&#39;s food. And as always, it&#39;s a big collection of coders of every skill level presenting on subjects that inspire them and hopefully inspire you too.

Several tracks give you a wide choice of information to glean, and a couple of gatherings of the entire crowd give you a chance to rub shoulders with your peers.

If my sessions are accepted, I&#39;ll be presenting on some IoT topics. That&#39;s what really drives my boat these days. As of this writing, the speaker registration is still open. You don&#39;t have to be a wizard to present. Beginners are just as welcome as experts. So work up some courage, dust off your public speaking book from college, and sign up.

I&#39;m looking forward to it. See you there.
