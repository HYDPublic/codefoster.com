Semantic Zoom is super easy, but even the easy things can use some conceptual explanation and examples to clarify them. Rest assured that once you see it, you'll go "Ah! That won't be a problem then."

If you use XAML/C# to make your Metro apps, then you should check out [Jerry Nixon's post on semantic zoom](http://blog.jerrynixon.com/2012/03/windows-8-semantic-zoom-versus-optical.html#more).

So, I'm going to be talking about Semantic Zoom. You know what that is right? It's different from optical zoom. It's a Windows 8 differentiator and it's really helpful. It's a way of zooming out of some information and making it easier to orient and easier to consume. Optical zoom just scales everything. Semantic zoom shows a different logical version of the _same_ list.

Any given list in a Windows 8 screen may be 3 or 4 or 5 screens worth of horizontal information, right? Well, it's not hard to pan that far, but it's not always easy to really see what your scope is when it's on 4 screens. When a user semantically zooms out, he is hoping to get oriented with your data. He is hoping to rise up so he can understand and/or so he can dive back in at just the right place.

I'm going to provide an example here. My example is a list of attractions in Kauai. Each has a _category_ property - things like Flora, Scenery, Waterfall, etc. I will use these categories to group my list, but with the grouping and all of the content I want to show, the list is about 4 screens wide...

This might be a good scope of data for this view in my app, but at the same time it might be too much to expect a user to be able to consume in a glance. So, we implement semantic zoom. When the user pinch zooms, we want to show them something like this...

![](/files/semanticzoom_02.png)

This is not very stylish, I know, but it serves to make the point. We want to indicate in much less horizontal space (and hopefully on a single screen) what our data contains. In this case, we're showing the categories. We could get quite creative with what we show here. The concept is to logically expand our scope to orient the user.

Now when the user chooses the Waterfall tile, he'll be semantically zoomed back in and will be taken directly to the waterfall section. The user can also zoom back in using a stretch zoom gesture (two fingers on the screen and then moved further apart).

Let's move on to how to implement this. It's by no means rocket science. Unless of course you're building an app for... er... rocket science.

Start off with a blank Metro application. First thing you're going to need is the data.

In your default.js file, add an onready function like this...

``` css
app.onready = function (args) {

};
```

And then inside of it add your data like this...

``` js
var attractions = [
    { name: "Fern Grotto", category: "Flora", location: "East", imageUrl: "http://www.kauai.com/photos/kauai/point/98/super/fern_grotto-kauai-attraction.JPG", description: "Only accessible by boat or Kayak, the fern Grotto is located about two miles up Kauai's Wailua River, the only navigable river in the State of Hawaii." },

];
```

And then you need to turn that simple JavaScript array into a Binding List so you can bind to it. Like this...

``` js
var attractionsList = new WinJS.Binding.List(attractions);
```

And then you group that list like this...

``` js
var attractionsListGrouped = attractionsList.createGrouped(
    function (i) { return i.category; }, //group key
    function (i) { return { category: i.category }; }  //group
);
```

And there's that.

Now, let's visit your HTML file (default.html).

You'll need your actual ListView...

``` html
<div id="zoomedinlist" data-win-control="WinJS.UI.ListView"></div>
```

And you'll also need a template and a header template...

``` html
<div id="headertemplate" data-win-control="WinJS.Binding.Template">
    <div data-win-bind="innerText:category"></div>
</div>
<div id="zoomedintemplate" data-win-control="WinJS.Binding.Template">
    <div>
        <img class="item-image" data-win-bind="src:imageUrl" />
        <div data-win-bind="innerText:name"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

And then you need to bind the ListView to your data, so go back to your default.js file and after the var attractionsListGrouped statement, add this...

``` js
var zin = q("#zoomedinlist").winControl;
zin.itemDataSource = attractionsListGrouped.dataSource;
zin.groupDataSource = attractionsListGrouped.groups.dataSource;
zin.itemTemplate = q("#zoomedintemplate");
zin.groupHeaderTemplate = q("#headertemplate");
```

Now you should have a working list, and all we have to do is add the semantically zoomed out version and the semantic zoom control itself.

So, on the default.html page, add the semantic zoom control and the zoomedoutlist to the list you already have like this...

``` html
<div data-win-control="WinJS.UI.SemanticZoom">
    <div id="zoomedinlist" data-win-control="WinJS.UI.ListView"></div>
    <div id="zoomedoutlist" data-win-control="WinJS.UI.ListView"></div>
</div>
```

(note that last code should be pasted _over_ the existing zoomedinlist since we already had that there)

Then, that zoomedoutlist needs some data binding, so we go back to the default.js and add this...

``` js
var zout = q("#zoomedoutlist").winControl;
zout.itemDataSource = attractionsListGrouped.groups.dataSource;
zout.itemTemplate = q("#zoomedouttemplate");
```

OKAY STOP. Let me explain what's going on here. Quite simply, we're just adding two different ListView controls with their own data bindings (that happen to be based on the same data, and then we are wrapping both of those up with the WinJS.UI.SemanticZoom control.

Keep in mind, that there are no constraints necessarily on what can comprise those two lists. You, the developer, are responsible for making sure that your semantic zoom control makes good sense for the user.

Now, please notice that the data source for the zoomed in list is a _grouped list of attractions_, while the data source for the zoomed out list is _a list of groups_. Thanks why we get the categories for our zoomed out tiles.

I added a couple of classes in the templates that I had you paste into your HTML, so if you add the following style rules to your default.css file, then that should make everything look sensible...

``` css
.item-image {
    width: 280px;
    height: 210px;
}

.sz-category {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
    font-weight:bold;
    font-size: large;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

And that should do it. Leave a comment if this was helpful. Actually, leave a comment if it wasn't helpful too. :)

Happy zooming.
