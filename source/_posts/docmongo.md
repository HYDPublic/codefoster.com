On March 31, 2016 it was announced at //build and also by Stephen Baron [via the DocumentDB blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-documentdb-protocol-support-for-mongodb/) that DocumentDB could now be used as the cloud data store for apps that already target MongoDB.

There&#39;s [a good video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B840) all about DocumentDB that came out of the recent [//build](http://build.microsoft.com) event, and if you [jump to 16:20](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B840#time=16m20s) you&#39;ll hear John Macintyre describe this new offering in good detail.

<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">In this post, I&#39;d like to break down what this means and why I think this is cool beans.</span>

First of all, if you&#39;re itching to get started, just check out how to join the preview program in the [aforementioned blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/documentdb-protocol-mongodb/).

<span style="line-height: 15.6px;">What does this mean in my own words? Keep in mind that my words tend not to contain a lot of technical speak. I have to keep things well organized in my mind if I&#39;m to avoid insanity - an aspect of my personality that I&#39;m hoping works to your when I record my thoughts in video or in this case in HTML.</span>

I&#39;ll start with what this is _not_. This is not a driver or an adapter. It&#39;s not a package that you install that translates everything you do against Mongo into underlying calls to DocumentDB&#39;s API.

That would be pretty cool, and I&#39;m not certain that it didn&#39;t already exist, but this is not that. The team decided on an approach that was lower level, more performant, and more compatible. They decided to essentially build MongoDB wire-level protocol compatibility into DocumentDB.

This is more performant because it doesn&#39;t rely on any sort of adapter. It&#39;s more compatible because it doesn&#39;t care what tools, libraries, or techniques you use to talk to MongoDB today. Whatever strategy you use will inevitably result in MongoDB protocol compatible messages on the wire, and that&#39;s going to work with DocumentDB.

I&#39;d also like to attempt to position this against the open-source MongoDB code base that currently exists.

Is this Microsoft&#39;s attempt to compete with Mongo? No way.

If anything, this is a recognition of the power and popularity of MongoDB.

DocumentDB&#39;s support of this protocol doesn&#39;t, in fact, do away with the need for MongoDB. DocumentDB is only a cloud service. You can&#39;t install DocumentDB in a mobile app and run it offline. You can do that with MongoDB.

On the contrary, you use DocumentDB and this protocol when you _already know_ MongoDB, but you want the many benefits of hosting your database in the cloud as a managed service - the primary advantages being scale and elasticity.

Take a look at [this great article](http://db-engines.com/en/system/Microsoft+Azure+DocumentDB%3BMongoDB) about the similarities and differences between MongoDB and DocumentDB.

This announcement appears to me to capture the strengths of these platforms without being forced to accept the shortcomings of either.
