Thanks to everyone that showed up to last Friday&#39;s session on JavaScript game development in Windows 8\. I really appreciated the information and demonstration that Jake and Sam presented. I hope it was as helpful for you too.

I said I&#39;d post the sample code that they used, and here it is. You will need to go to impactjs.com and purchase the library if you&#39;d like to use this, but if you&#39;re actually making games then it&#39;s a small cost to consider.

Enjoy!
