![](http://codefoster.blob.core.windows.net/site/image/77e70d31a5cc4bdb8dd5b55eccc15a31/cssbook_01_1.png)My CSS for Windows 8 App Development book is done... finished... finite! You can get an ebook or an old fashioned paper style book by visiting [aka.ms/cssbook](http://aka.ms/cssbook). I hope the book adds something to your CSS skills. The source code for the listings in the book is available at [cssbookcode.codeplex.com](http://cssbookcode.codeplex.com). Enjoy!
