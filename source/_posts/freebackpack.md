codefoster.com is entirely overhauled and with it my provider for blog commenting functionality.
<!-- xmore -->


I chose [DISQUS](http://disqus.com) and I&#39;m pretty happy with it so far. It was very easy to plug in and gives me the basic commenting functionality that I&#39;d like. I like the fact that many web users have used the system before and are already authenticated. I also like that comment threads can be tied to the page URL and are not tied into the content management software.

In an attempt to engage you, my readers, I&#39;d like to offer an Oakley backpack like the one pictured below except it&#39;s branded with the new Microsoft logo in gray.

To enter, either leave a comment below with your answer to the following question: _What are the most important 3 items to carry in your day pack and have at the ready?_ or leave a comment on any other blog post on codefoster.com.

Unfortunately, I can only ship to the U.S., but if you&#39;re overseas I&#39;d still love to hear your answer.

I&#39;ll pick a random winner this Friday the 25th and announce it in a comment and on Twitter.
