codefoster.com is entirely overhauled and with it my provider for blog commenting functionality.
<!-- more -->


I chose [DISQUS](http://disqus.com) and I'm pretty happy with it so far. It was very easy to plug in and gives me the basic commenting functionality that I'd like. I like the fact that many web users have used the system before and are already authenticated. I also like that comment threads can be tied to the page URL and are not tied into the content management software.

In an attempt to engage you, my readers, I'd like to offer an Oakley backpack like the one pictured below except it's branded with the new Microsoft logo in gray.

To enter, either leave a comment below with your answer to the following question: _What are the most important 3 items to carry in your day pack and have at the ready?_ or leave a comment on any other blog post on codefoster.com.

Unfortunately, I can only ship to the U.S., but if you're overseas I'd still love to hear your answer.

I'll pick a random winner this Friday the 25th and announce it in a comment and on Twitter.
