I&#39;m not far from setting sail in a 38&#39; boat for what promises to be an epic voyage by my standards. I have done plenty of sailing, but entirely within sight of land.

<aside>The sight of land is quite an encouragement when you&#39;re in a boat. Even when a swim for shore isn&#39;t remotely possible, it&#39;s warming to imagine it is.</aside>

This last weekend, I took my family down to Westport, WA to have a look at the boat and meet some of the crew. All of the logistics are falling into place and one day in early August I&#39;ll shove off, head offshore, and not stop until we reach San Diego. That&#39;s about a 1200 mile trek. I won&#39;t be tweeting or blogging during the voyage (except the scheduled stuff), but I will be taking plenty of GoPro footage which I&#39;ll attempt to share.

Here&#39;s to fair southerly winds!
