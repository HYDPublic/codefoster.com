At OSCON this year, Olivier Bloch and I declare Portland to be the open source capital of the world, and while our declaration might not be official, it certainly makes sense.

The breadth of innovation represented in the exhibit hall is both impressive and inspiring.

In this special edition of CodeChat, I have a good chat with Olivier Bloch from Microsoft Open Technologies about the variety of ways that Microsoft collaborates with open source software and some exciting topics in the area of IoT. Enjoy.
