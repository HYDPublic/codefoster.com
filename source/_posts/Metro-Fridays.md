Developers anywhere near Seattle, I&#39;m talking to you.


If you&#39;re developing Windows 8 applications, we want to support you. We&#39;re going to be at Microsoft&#39;s Civica location (easy to find, free parking, free coffee, etc.) every Friday in June and July (except July 6). Join us in person or via Lync to get live help coding your app or talking about getting your app into the store.

I&#39;ll add details and logistics to this blog post as they unfold, so check back.

Here is the latest on the dates and times of the Metro Friday meetings. Some are daytime and others are in the evening to best accommodate everyone. If you are not in the area, feel free to use the Lync below to connect online.
