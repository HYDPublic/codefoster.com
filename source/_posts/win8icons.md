**UPDATE: since writing this I've found [this MSDN article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj841126.aspx) that I think has more information than my post. Hope that's helpful.**

This is a reference post. Come back when you, like me, forget which icons are available to use on your application bar in your Windows 8 app.
<!-- xmore -->

If you define your app bar imperatively (in JavaScript), then you would simply pass the name of the icon from this graphic in as the icon option like so...

``` js
new WinJS.UI.AppBarCommand({..., icon:'bookmarks', ...})
```

Here's the chart for those with young eyes :)
