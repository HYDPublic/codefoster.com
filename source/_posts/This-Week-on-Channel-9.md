This week I recorded This Week on Channel 9 with my good friend and colleague Steve Seow ([@SteveSeow](http://twitter.com/steveseow)). Steve knows startups, and this week I invited him to join me as we present some pretty cool content about Docker, the VS Unity Tools, Node, home automation, the Intel Edison, and lots of other goodies. Have a look.
