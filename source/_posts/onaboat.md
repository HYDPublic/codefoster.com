As you read this, I'm in the Pacific ocean, actually hopefully I'm _on_ the Pacific ocean in a sail boat.

If you know me, you know that I'm a little into sailing. It would be more accurate to say that I'm into _cruising_. Sailing is something you do to make a boat go forward without costing you any money. Cruising is something you do to spend time with friends and family in the sun, in the water, in the wild.

I get precious little time to do either right now since I'm raising a young family, but my wife and I are entertaining eventual dreams of some serious voyaging and decided to get some big ocean experience sooner than later to append to my extensive coastal cruising days.

I'll be at sea for about 1200 miles without any site of land, and you can bet I brought some serious digital resources to take advantage of the long helm shifts.

So if you send me an email, you'll get an OOF message. I won't be checking it out here. There will be no flashing lights (except for my GoPro) or ringing chimes for missed text messages.

If my sanity returns with me I'll post photos here.

Fair winds.
